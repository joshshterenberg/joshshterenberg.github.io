<h3>Goal</h3>

Improve resolution of charged particle trajectory reconstruction, decrease computation time.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

LHC tracks mix, which produce merged clusters of charge in tracking layers. IT's difficult to optimize splitting these clusters. As the angle between a track and jet decreases, efficiency decreases. To improve reconstruction, enter DeepCore: a CNN that is basically doing it all on its own, and helps gain efficiency with high momentum. DeepCore has its own drawbacks: not clear if ti's learning correctly, doesnâ€™t work well for endcaps, inefficient predictions, and constrains data representations. We want a GNN instead to help mitigate these drawbacks.
