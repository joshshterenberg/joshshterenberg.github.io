I am a PhD student and researcher at Princeton University, advised by Paul Steinhardt. I am currently researching numerical simulations for bouncing cosmologies and black hole perturbation theory. 

I recently worked at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), where I studied the post-Newtonian expansion of binary systems, using simulations therein to test the efficability of future graviational wave detectors.

Previously, I graduated from Boston University with a B.A. in Physics and a B.S. in Computer Engineering. There I held a research position at CERN International Labs as part of the CMS Collaboration, improving the tasks of vertex reconstruction and track seed generation in the CMSSW.

Out of the office, you can find me tutoring on Wyzant, playing music, and otherwise hobby-experimenting.
