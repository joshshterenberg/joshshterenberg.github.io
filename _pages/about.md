I am a PhD student and researcher at Princeton University, advised by Paul Steinhardt. I am currently researching numerical simulations for bouncing cosmologies. 

I recently worked at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), where I studied black hole perturbation theory and the post-Newtonian expansion of binary systems, using simulations therein to test the efficability of future graviational wave detectors.

I graduated from Boston University with a B.A. in Physics and a B.S. in Computer Engineering. There I held a research position at CERN International Labs as part of the CMS Collaboration, improving the tasks of vertex reconstruction and track seed generation in the CMSSW. I also held research positions at multiple labs on campus where I lead projects on dark matter data searches, cluster job scheduling, anomaly detection in HPC systems, and more.

Out of the office, you can find me tutoring on Wyzant, operating ham radio, crocheting, <a href='https://joshshterenberg.github.io/blog'>blogging</a>, and otherwise hobby-experimenting.
