I am a student and researcher at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), advised by Matias Zaldarriaga. My current research is bifocal: black hole perturbation theory and data analysis of gravitational waves.

Before Princeton, I graduated from Boston University with a B.A. in Physics and a B.S. in Computer Engineering. There I held a research position at CERN International Labs as part of the CMS Collaboration, improving the tasks of vertex reconstruction and track seed generation in the CMSSW.

Out of the office, you can find me tutoring on Wyzant, playing music, and learning languages.
