      "summary": "We use Fisher information theory to forecast the bounds on the finite-size effects of astrophysical compact objects with next-generation gravitational wave detectors, including the ground-based Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), as well as the space-based Laser Infrared Space Antenna (LISA). Exploiting the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism, we first characterize three types of quadrupole finite-size effects: the spin-induced quadrupole moments, the conservative tidal deformations, and the tidal heating. We then derive the corresponding contributions to the gravitational waveform phases for binary compact objects in aligned-spin quasi-circular orbits. We separately estimate the constraints on these finite-size effects for black holes using the power spectral densities (PSDs) of the CE+ET detector network and LISA observations. For the CE+ET network, we find that the bounds on the mass-weighted spin-independent dissipation number H0H0​ are of the order O(1)O(1), while the bounds on the mass-weighted tidal Love number Λ~Λ~ are of the order O(10)O(10). For high-spin binary black holes with dimensionless spin χ≃0.8χ≃0.8, the bounds on the symmetric spin-induced quadrupole moment κsκs​ are of the order O(10−1)O(10−1). LISA observations of supermassive black hole mergers offer slightly tighter constraints on all three finite-size parameters. Additionally, we perform a Fisher analysis for a binary neutron star merger within the CE+ET network. The bounds on the tidal parameter H0H0​ and on Λ~Λ~ are around two orders of magnitude better than the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) bounds."
